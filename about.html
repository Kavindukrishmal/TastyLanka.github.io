							<h4>Taste Lanka! Welcome to Tasty Sri Lanka Recipes.</h4>
							<p>
								Taste Lanka is a blog that share Tasty Sri Lankan recipes world wide. Anyone who wants to try the Sri Lankan foods without traveling to Sri Lanka. Each and every recipe in this has been written with great care and love to the best ability with you in mind. It’s free and onsite, for you to try anytime. Some may say that they can’t find some of the ingredients mentioned here.
								 <br>Yes it’s true. As a Sri Lankan living outside of the home country even I’m facing the same issue. But you can use subtitle for these. As an example, for the curry leaves you can use Kaffir lime leaves also known as their other name makrut lime, Lemon zest or lime zest, Basil leaves and Bay leaves. If you are using basil leaves I suggest to use lime or lemon zest alongside. Using the substitute may change the flavor and aroma slightly but will not effect the main dish.

								As a tip for better taste I will recommend to use tomatoes for the chicken and fish curries. This will make the gravy much more thicker and creamier than the normal. And instead of tamarind you can use tomatoes. If any one wants to replace the meats with vegetables yes you can. But keep in mind what kind of veggies you’re using. You can try out these recipe with mushrooms. I would suggest button mushrooms or any kind of hardy mushrooms. You can also try tofu.
